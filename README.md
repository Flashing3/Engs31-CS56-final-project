## "Chinese Music MIDI Pad"

This final project is for the ENGS 31/ COSC 56 Digital Electronics during Spring 2018 at Dartmouth College.

We designed and implemented a MIDI Pad on a Basys FPGA.  The artists and musicians could use our product to play five traditional Chinese music instruments' sounds, record them and replay them to create innovative music pieces. We programmed in Matlab and VHDL. In order to achieve the design, we extensively used the knowledge about sampling music pieces, boolean algebra, logic minimization, algorithmic state machine abstractions, synchronous system design, peripheral modularization programming, debugging and etc.
